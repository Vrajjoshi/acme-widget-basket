# Acme Widget Co - Ruby Basket System
 
This is a proof of concept for Acme Widget Co's basket logic, including:
- A product catalog
- Special offers (like buy 1 get 2nd red widget half price)
- Tiered delivery pricing
 
## Features
 
- Add items by product code
- Calculates total including discounts and delivery
- Easy to extend with new offers
 
## Assumptions
 
- Offers are hardcoded for now
- Product prices are fixed
- Only valid product codes are used
 
## How to Run
 
```bash
ruby setup.rb
